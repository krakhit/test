# General Rules

---
**Level 1** topics like [Zero Knolwdge Proofs](./ZKP.md) & [DEFI](./Defi.md) must have:
 
 - Curated Resources 
 - Articles
 - Lecture Series 
 - Protocols

They may or may not also include:
 - Hands-On
 - Mathematics
 - Any other **Level 1** Related Topic
---
If a **Level 2** Topic (ex: [Articles](./introzkp.md)) has Sub-Topics (**Level 3**s) it must have a Table of contents of its included topics, if not (ex: [Lecture Series](./zkpseries.md)) it may have its contents displayed on it

---
The **Articles** section of any **level 1** should preferably be broken down to an **Intoductory** vs. other relative topics, and the **Introductory** should preferably be broken down by beginner to advanced
